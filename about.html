                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Hi there! I'm the cat-obsessed founder of Gato Chateau. After years of struggling to find trustworthy care for my own cats whenever I traveled, I decided to create the service I always wished existed.</p>
                        <p>I know how hard it is to leave your fur baby behind. That nagging worry on the plane, constantly wondering if they're okay. That's exactly why I started sending daily photo updates - so you can see with your own eyes that your kitty is happy, healthy, and probably getting more attention than usual!</p>
                        <p>Every cat that comes into our care becomes part of our extended family. We learn their favorite spots, their quirky habits, and exactly how they like their chin scratched. Because cats aren't just pets - they're family members who deserve the very best.</p>
